# TISSUE DB for ISO/IEC TS 30168

ISO/IEC TS 30168 is an emerging standard for the integration of secure elements into the application software used on industrial IoT devices. After publication of the first edition in 2024 the technical specification is now in its early state of adaptation. First implementation projects are being started.

One example is the open source project started with the goal to lower the entry barrier to implement the standard for early adaptors [https://github.com/generic-trust-anchor-api](https://github.com/generic-trust-anchor-api).

It is expected that implementation projects will increase interest in ISO/IEC TS 30168 but will also reveal errors and/or omissions in the technical specification, which are referred to as technical issues (TISSUE) in the following.

In order to resolve these TISSUES in a coordinated way, it is recognized that a responsive process is needed to address said errors or omissions in the Standard which are likely to cause interoperability problems between implementations on the market.

The TISSUE process described in this document shall be a vital part of the future development of ISO/IEC TS 30168. To ensure successful cooperation a well-defined process would be of value to the market, industry, and community to reduce the number of interpretations required to understand tissue resolution.

At the time being the focus of the TISSUE process is on the maintenance of ISO/IEC TS 30168. Especially, conformance testing of different implementations against the technical specification has not yet been addressed. The TISSUE process may be enhanced in the future, especially as implementations for ISO/IEC TS 30168 get available from multiple vendors. Resolved TISSUES relating to missing or unclear or to be corrected parts of ISO/IEC TS 30168 are intended to be announced using the IEC INF document process and are considered when amending or revising ISO/IEC TS 30168.

This document aims to provide a comprehensive description of the TISSUE process for ISO/IEC TS 30168 and the responsibilities of each user. The latest version of this process description is publicly available [here](TISSUE_Guide_for_IEC_TS_30168.pdf).
